# WeightTracker

This is a sample project which purpose is to put in practice my knowledge of working with Angular.

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

## What did I learn?

- How to bootstrap an Angular application using the Angular cli.
- How to define components, templates and services.
- How to connect an API by subscribing to RxJS events.
- How to integrate third-party libraries like NgChart.
- How to add URL routing.

## Backend API

This sample project uses the Express API app from [here](https://github.com/Andrew4d3/api-weight-tracker). So first install and run that project before running this one.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
